    "about": "Nice to meet you! I'm an aspiring web and mobile developer with a passion for building practical, user-friendly solutions. I believe that technology should be simple, effective, and enhance everyday life. Whether it’s a website, an app, or a custom solution, my goal is to create intuitive experiences that make a difference. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me gaming on my PC, diving into books about history and politics, or enjoying Premier League Darts on a Thursday night.",
