    "about":"I'm a junior full-stack web and mobile developer passionate about building clean, practical, and user-friendly solutions that make a real difference in everyday life. \n\nFrom sleek front-end interfaces built with React, Angular, and TailwindCSS to robust back-end systems powered by Django, ASP.NET, and SQL Server, I enjoy transforming real-world problems into simple, effective digital tools.\n\n I bring hands-on experience working with RESTful APIs, Agile workflows, and DevOps tools such as Git and Vercel, always aiming for accessible, maintainable code that scales. When I’m not coding, I’m likely diving into a good book on history or politics, gaming on my PC, or watching darts and rugby matches. I'm curious about how the world works and excited to keep building for it.",
